        <h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm the author and creator of The Violet Couch. I was inspired to create a personal blog site back in 2011. Over the years I have always been on and off with 
        researching subjects and writing articles. Fast forward to today, this is my official site that embodies and reflects a place where I can publish articles that I've written. 

        I have a B.S. in Computer Science and am currently working in tech. You can learn more 
        about my professional background <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>.
